    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Japanese curry (カレー, karē)</strong> is commonly served in three
      main forms: curry over rice (カレーライス, karē raisu), curry udon (curry
      over thick noodles), and curry bread (カレーパン, karē pan) (a
      curry-filled pastry). It is one of the most popular dishes in Japan. The
      very common "curry rice" is most often referred to simply as "curry"
      (カレー, karē).
    </p>

    <p>
      Along with the sauce, a wide variety of vegetables and meats are used to
      make Japanese curry. The basic vegetables are onions, carrots, and
      potatoes. Beef, pork, and chicken are the most popular meat choices. Katsu
      curry is a breaded deep-fried cutlet (tonkatsu; usually pork or chicken)
      with Japanese curry sauce.
